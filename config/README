PRE_REQUISITES
PHP needs to have enabled (in PHP.ini) the following extensions:
- php_curl.dll
- php_openssl.dll
- php_pdo_mysql.dll
- php_mysql.dll		(uncertain if needed)
- php_mysqli.dll	(uncertain if needed)
- php_mbstring.dll	(uncertain if needed)


INSTALLATION

1. Database
Setup your schema definition using "HAC Server/database/db_schema.sql"
Modify it appropriately by setting your own database name

2. Setup database connection
Open "HAC Server/config/config.php" in an editor and define your database constants

3. Define services information
	- Open "HAC Server/config/setup.php" in a browser
	- Set the global_settings
		If you don't use "data_update" you need to setup a seperate scheduler that will call the cron.php script
	- Configure UI and Data settings for the services that you wish to enable
	
4. Set the "serverBaseURL" parameter in the client code : "HAC Client/js/client.js" to point to your server.
	
That's it.

Call cron.php from a browser to activate the first load and you will also see if all enabled services are being
properly loaded.
